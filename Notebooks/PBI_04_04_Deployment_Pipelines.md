## Power BI Deployment Pipelines
-----

- The tool is designed as a pipeline with three stages:

### Development

- This stage is used to design, build, and upload new content with fellow creators. This is the first stage in deployment pipelines.

### Test

- You're ready to enter the test stage after you've made all the needed changes to your content. You upload the modified content so it can be moved to this test stage. Here are three examples of what can be done in the test environment:
- Share content with testers and reviewers
- Load and run tests with larger volumes of data
- Test your app to see how it will look for your end users

### Production

- After testing the content, use the production stage to share the final version of your content with business users across the organization.

### Questions
1. After deployment(from dev to test) one report added to dev. Then will it automatically will appear in test?
  - NO, We need click on Dev **Deploy** button
2. As a developer what workspace i will have access?
  - Dev
3. Accidentely removed one report from Dev, Can i copy a report from test to dev?
  - No. (Work around is Request Admin to download PBIX file from test and publis pbix file to Dev)
###**Clarifications 

Business request: We have two different PBIX files in Power BI and we need to merge these two PBIX files into ONE SINGLE PBIX file and deploy the code into DEV.
How should we do this PBIX files merge sir? Kindly let us know.
